			<p>Sourcetorio is an unofficial Factorio Server for Source Allies, which is being created to celebrate the release of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/645390/Factorio_Space_Age/">Factorio: Space Age DLC</a>.</p>
			<p>The server will launch within minutes of the DLC release on <span class="text-gradient-animated">October 21, 2024</span></p>
			<br/>
			<Countdown releaseDateString='October 21, 2024 00:00:00' client:load/>

		<CardSection title="Getting Started">
			<p>If you already own the game, awesome! You can skip ahead. If you don't - don't fret!! There's a couple things to know about your unfotunate, Factorioless condition.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The game never goes on sale. This may sound like a bad thing, but at least you'll never be sitting around waiting for a sale, right?</li>
				<li>You will need the DLC. This is specifically a <span class="text-gradient-animated">Factorio: Space Age</span> server.</li>
				<li>The game has no DRM, and the server will have Authentication disabled. This means you can very easily use someone else's shared game files if you like.</li>
			</ul>
		</CardSection>
		<CardSection title="Connecting">
			<p>Simple! Just use the "Connect to Address" menu to connect to my site:</p>
			<code class="code-block">factorio.qrimby.com</code>
			<p>Yes, I can confirm that this is a funny dns name. I use it for a few things :) </p>
		</CardSection>
		<CardSection title="Da Rulez">
			<p>You didn't think there would be rules, did you? Or at the very least, you probably expected a familiar "the only rules are no rules!! :P"</p>
			<br/>
			<p>NO. That would be RIDICULOUS. This is VERY SERIOUS!</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Jokes aside, I'm not planning on banning anyone, so these rules serve more as guidelines for how to have the best time. I've played a LOT of <span class="text-gradient-animated">Factorio</span>, and I have some opinions about how best to approach the game to have a good time.</p>
			<h3>Rule No. 1</h3>
			<p>Please use Alt mode. If you press the "Alt" key it shows some helpful icons over machines that let you know what they're up to at a glance.</p>
			
			<h3>Rule No. 2</h3>
			<p>Don't refactor! It's always tempting to tear down some machines and build them back better, but there's a couple really good reasons not to.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>They might be someone else's. Please don't "I could do this better" someone's whole dang project.</li>
				<li>Space is unlimited.* Leave what's there, perhaps repurpose its outputs, and build something new!</li>
			</ul>
			<p style="font-size: 0.8rem">* space is actually limited to 4 trillion tiles. If your project needs more than that, please show me - that sounds awesome.</p>

			<h3>Rule No. 3</h3>
			<p>Please don't look up "optimal" designs or blueprints online. Your own design probably won't be <span class="text-gradient-animated">MegaPerfect</span>, but it will be yours. The whole point of the game is to solve neat logistics puzzles - you wouldn't look up the solution to the Wordle, would you?</span></p>
