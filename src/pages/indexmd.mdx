Sourcetorio is an unofficial Factorio Server for Source Allies,
which is being created to celebrate the release of the
[Factorio: Space Age DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/645390/Factorio_Space_Age/).

The server will launch at <span class="text-gradient-animated">5:30 PM on October 21, 2024</span> - the day the DLC releases.

<Countdown releaseDateString="2024-10-21T22:30:00.000Z" client:load />

The rest of this site serves as a guide on how to participate on the server and a source of details about the launch event.

Already have the game? Great!

Don't? No worries. Here's a few fun tidbits that can help you out.
- The game never goes on sale. This may sound bad, but it means that you'll never succumb to "waiting for a sale"-itis.
- You will need the DLC. This is specifically a Factorio: Space Age server.
- The game has no DRM, and the server will have authentication disabled.
- The Switch version will not include the DLC, so it will not work for this server.
This means that you can easily share game files with a friend.
If you're in need of a copy, DM me on Slack <span class="text-gradient">@brennan</span> and I can give a few pointers.

First join <a href="https://discord.gg/scWc58ckr3">the Discord Server</a>.
You may notice that this isn't the official SAI Discord - that's so that you can
invite non-SAI friends if you like.

Configuring the game is not too hard, there's really just two steps.
### Step One - Version Control
Factorio servers do not auto-update. So if your game updates you will no longer be able to access the server until I get around to updating it. I highly recommend configuring your game to not auto-update.

- If you're *not* using a *Steam Copy*, the game gives you control over when it updates.
<span class="text-gradient-animated">This is awesome.</span> You're good to go.

- If you're on *Steam*, you can use your Steam login to grab a free non-Steam copy from <a href="https://factorio.com">factorio.com</a>.

- If you really want to remain on Steam, you can pin your game version by right-clicking
the game in your library, going to properties > betas, and selecting a version from the dropdown.

The verson we're going with is <span class="text-gradient">2.0.7</span>. I'll make a fuss if we choose to update it.
### Step Two - Logging In

Head to Multiplayer > Connect to Address, and enter in this site's domain name.

Finally, I get to be a despot!

The rules are pretty simple.
1. Don't tear down other peoples' stuff. If you think you could do a better job, just build it somewhere else - the map has 4 trillion tiles so you might as well use em.
2. There is no personal property. Items, vehicles, spaceships, all up for grabs.
3. Try not to AFK for long periods of time.
4. Please don't copy/paste blueprints from the internet.
5. No Biter Sympathizers

Obviously there are exceptions to these (except the last rule). Just try to be chill.

<CardSection title="FAQ" collapsing={true} startCollapsed={false} client:idle>
### I'm a total newbie, what if I don't like the game?

If you're new, I highly recommend the demo. You can get it <a href="https://factorio.com/download">from their site</a>

### I forgot when the event starts. It's all the way at the top of the page.

To ensure that plenty of people can participate, we're going to be starting at 5:30 PM on October 21.

### The DLC drops at midnight - can I get started early?

The server may be up before 5:30, but please don't get started early - I want a coordinated launch from scratch!

### Can I invite my friends?
Please do! Try to select for friends who you consider <span class="text-gradient-animated">cool</span>üòé
